    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a passionate web developer dedicated to creating responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites. 
        I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, efficient solutions and writing code that is both functional and easy to maintain.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the years, I have gained experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am constantly exploring new technologies 
        and frameworks to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with modern web development trends.
    </p>

    <p>
        My goal is to craft websites that not only look great but also provide seamless experiences for users across all devices. 
        I take pride in collaborating effectively with teams, paying attention to details, and delivering projects that meet both client and user expectations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When I am not coding, I enjoy learning about UI/UX design, experimenting with new design trends, and contributing to 
        open-source projects that help other developers.
